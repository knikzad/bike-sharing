# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
## Annual membership versus casual use of bike sharing
Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to
commute to work each day.

### Business task:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. How to convert casual riders to annual members?

### Deliverables:
By analyzing the [previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), I intend to produce a report that includes the following deliverables:
1. A clear statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of your analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis
